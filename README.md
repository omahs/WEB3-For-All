**Welcome to this ultimate repository which will turn you into a WEB3 Developer!**
<br>
> ‚ö†Ô∏è All the code associated with this repository is written by me, and is intended to help learners to take reference from it and build their own amazing stuff. Please don't copy paste the exact code if you find yourself in trouble while coding, instead take reference and then build intuition for it and code yourself. I highly support project based learning and suggest everyone to make projects while learning, because that will shine in your resume and also enhance your portfolio!

# IDEs Over You Can Buildü•å
## IDE platforms:

### 1. Remix

[Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) is a free and open-source online IDE for developing Solidity on Ethereum or other blockchains that support the EVM. Remix is well-liked since it supports the complete software development lifecycle and enables users to get started quickly.

Its features:

- It solely supports browsers
- It comes with a nice compiler
- Server-side components are not found with it
- You can easily build Ethereum contracts using Solidity with it.

### 2. ETHFiddle

[EthFiddle](https://ethfiddle.com/) is a 2017-released, Loom Network-powered online Solidity IDE. EthFiddle's user-friendly interface makes it easy for programmers to create, test, and debug smart contracts online for free.

Its features:

- It enables users to readily give out Solidity code snippets among their loved ones.
- It also gives you the opportunity to check out the web for nice code snippets.


### 3. Yakindu

[Yakindu](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/yakindu-solidity-tools) is a free, Eclipse-based IDE for creating Ethereum and Solidity smart contracts. Yakindu is still used as an open-source IDE and was developed in 2017 by itemis AG. Yakindu offers a wide range of capabilities, including code completion, live validation, code navigation, templates, semantic highlighting, Solidity compiler integration, and much more. Its straightforward user interface is comparable to the Eclipse IDE's, making it recognisable to current users.

Its features:

- Live validation.
- It offers code completion.
- Integration of code compiler.
- Semantic highlighting.
- Code navigation.

### 4. Embark

[Embark](https://framework.embarklabs.io/) consists of a suite of developer tools on a command line interface (CLI) for building decentralised applications (dApps). Beyond the framework, its developer environment offers a one-stop shop for the decentralised application lifecycle.

Its features:

- Embark is a framework offers you another option of a software that can be used to create.
- Test and deploy applications.

# Learn About NFTs! ‚ùÑ (Optional)

> **NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are a type of digital asset that represent ownership of a unique item or piece of content, such as a digital art piece or collectible.** They are built on blockchain technology, which allows for secure and transparent tracking of ownership and transfers.

_One of the key features of NFTs is their non-fungibility, which means that they cannot be exchanged for an identical item. This is in contrast to fungible assets, such as cryptocurrencies, which are interchangeable._

NFTs have been gaining popularity in recent years, particularly in the digital art space. Artists and creators can use NFTs to monetize their work by selling unique digital assets directly to collectors. Additionally, NFTs can also be used for things like virtual real estate, in-game items, and more.

**One of the benefits of NFTs is that they provide a way for digital creators to prove ownership and control of their work. This can help to prevent plagiarism and copyright infringement, and also allows for the digital art market to grow and be more profitable for the artists.**

One of the downsides of NFTs is that they are not widely understood by the general public yet, and the technology is still relatively new. Additionally, the environmental impact of the blockchain technology used for NFTs is a concern that is currently being studied.

Here are a few examples of highly valuable and notable NFTs that have been sold in recent years:

- **"Everydays: The First 5000 Days"** by digital artist Mike Winkelmann, also known as Beeple, sold for **$69 million at Christie's auction house in March 2021**. This NFT is a collage of Beeple's digital artworks created over **13 years**, and it is considered one of the most valuable digital artworks ever sold.

- **"CryptoPunk #7804"** is a digital collectible of a unique pixel art character and it sold for $7.5 million in March 2021. It's one of 10,000 unique characters created by Larva Labs.

- **"The Last Few"** by artist Mad Dog Jones sold for** $411,000** in February 2021. This NFT is a 3D-animated short film that depicts a post-apocalyptic world and it is considered to be one of the most valuable pieces of 3D-animated digital art.

- **"The First 5000 Days**" is another digital artwork by Mike Winkelmann, also known as Beeple, sold at a Christie's auction for **$69.3 Million** in March 2021.

- **"Alien"** is a 3D digital artwork by artist Fewocious and it sold for **$69,346 in February 2021.** This NFT is a colorful, abstract representation of an alien, and it is considered one of the most valuable pieces of 3D digital art.

- "Everydays: The First 5000 Days" a digital artwork by Mike Winkelmann also known as Beeple, sold for **$69 million.**

**These are just a few examples, but there are many other highly valuable and notable NFTs that have been sold in the recent years. As the market for NFTs continues to grow and evolve, we can expect to see more high-value sales in the future.**

> ‚ùÑ‚ùÑ Overall, NFTs have the potential to revolutionize the way we think about digital ownership and monetization. As the technology and understanding of NFTs continue to evolve, we may see more use cases and mainstream adoption in the near future.‚úå‚úå
